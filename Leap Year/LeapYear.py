    A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. In reality, the 
    earth takes longer to rotate around the sun. To account for the difference in time, 
    every 4 years, a leap year takes place. A leap year is when a year has 366 days: 
    An extra day, February 29th. The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:

        1) The year must be divisible by 4
        2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400

    Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.
    Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a leap year.
